# Overview: Notebooks

- An app leaning loosely on the concept of bullet journalling
- It combines journals, lists and trackers
- It helps to evaluate where you are in your life, makes you think about your goals and helps building healthy habits that will help you achieve these
- It’s an archive of your life you can look back on to simply reminisce or to see how far you have come
- Easy and intuitive to use
- VNth: It helps you get started with suggestions where to start
  - Have one notebook per year. In that:
  - Create a gratitude journal. Create a new page every day and write down three things you’re grateful for or proud of. Link to article of mental health benefits of doing this.
  - Create a list page and write down goals you would like to achieve. Think of habits you’d like to build and where you want to be in a year / 5 years. Link to article of how setting goals improves success rate.
    Create a weekly habit tracker page for habits that will help you achieve your goals. Link to study of how long you need to do a habit so it becomes something that is done without having to think about it.
  - Create a to do list page
  - Start a mood tracker page every month to be able to see patterns in your moods
- Nth: Suggest other things you can do, eg create a recipe collection (as a journal, use sections for themes such as mains, deserts, etc)
- Nth: Can easily add pictures, screenshots, URLs to a page when browsing the internet or from pictures on phone
- Nth: Can share aspects of it with friends who are using the app too.

### Problem

I have been looking for an app to replace a physical notebook and can't find anything that combines journals, habit trackers, mood trackers, and lists, is easy to use and visually attractive / customisable.

Physical journals take up space and are time consuming to maintain. A journal on your phone can be udpated quickly, on the go, and doesn't use any extra space in your bag or bookshelf.

I would like the personal journey to be easily visualised by being able to scroll through notebooks and see old habits trackers, list, journal entries, etc.
